Blood is an ncurses toy made to practise my ANSI C. Sadly it has not much to do with Monolith's blood, but I will keep adding some features for a while in order to sharpen my programming skill.

Originally this was made back in 2004 on Pascal, so I don't want to make it look or feel different as that classroom practice.
